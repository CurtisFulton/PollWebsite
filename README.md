# Poll Website

This is my first project attempted in HTML. I am leaving
the code how I mostly did it the first time around to show my learning.

I choose a poll site because It has a simple design, yet has quite
a lot of complexity. Having to learn about DB's, CSS, HTML, and NodeJs 
all at once was a great learning experience.
